                    Greedy Monsters is a zero-player game in which a set number of monsters compete for
                    calories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a monster has no calories left, it is dead.
                    The last monster left is the winner of the game.
                    If no monsters have any calories at the end of a round, no winner can be declared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each monster get 5<sup>*</sup> calories at the start of the game.
                    The monsters will take turns in a round competing for calories.
                    For each round, the following steps will be performed for each monster:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A monster awakens and consumes one<sup>*</sup> calorie.</li>
                    <li>It is fed with an arbitrary number of calories between 1 and 3*.</li>
                    <li>There is a 20%<sup>*</sup> chance that these calories are toxic.
                        If so, they are subtracted from the monster's calories.
                    </li>
                    <li>There is a 50%<sup>*</sup> chance that this monster will steal half the calories of
                        another sleeping monster. Only one monster can steal for in each round.
                    </li>
                    <li>The monster goes back to sleep.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    When a new round starts, the monster with the least calories will wake up first.
                </p>
